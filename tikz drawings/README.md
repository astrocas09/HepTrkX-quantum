To produce a drawing use the examples in main.tex. 

When you compile, it will create a .pdf file for all the drawings in the ./tikz folder. Please do not delete any drawings, just add new ones.

Important Note: for LaTeX to create .pdf versions you need to compile using shell escape mode.   

How to turn on shell escape on MAC using TeXShop?:

Go to preferences --> engine: add "--shell-escape" at the end of the line in LaTeX command settings.

I couldn't find a way to convert tikz images to pdf using overleaf, please let me know if you know a way.
